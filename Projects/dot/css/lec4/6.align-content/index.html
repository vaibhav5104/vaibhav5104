<!-- 
    Definition: align-content is a CSS property used in Grid layouts. It determines how grid items are distributed along the block/cross (vertical) axis of a grid container when there is extra space.

    Block Axis: In a grid container, the block axis is the axis that is perpendicular to the main axis.
 -->

 <!-- 
    In a single-line flex container (where items do not wrap onto multiple lines), align-items is the property you would typically use to align items along the cross-axis.

In a multi-line flex container (where items wrap onto multiple lines), align-content can be used to control the alignment of those lines along the cross-axis.
